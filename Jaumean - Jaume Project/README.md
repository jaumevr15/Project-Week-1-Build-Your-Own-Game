## Project Description
After so many times being told people can't understand my particular language, I felt with the need to create theh one and only official translator to Jaumean language, the first step to create the language that will unite all citizens of Planet Earth.

## Rules
Users will be asked whether they want to translate from or to Jaumean.
Users will be requested to input whichever text in whichever language they want to translate into Jaumean or the opposite direction.
Users can input any possible character, including characters that are not especifically romanic.
There are several easter eggs with funny translations that represent the culture of the language.

## Workflow
1. Program definition and rules: First version of the readme file with the guidelines, main description and rules.
2. Research about the option of having dictionaries with any character and optimal approaches to simplify the program. 
3. Start the first version of the code, encounter first problems.
4. Once the basic program works, check on improvements or updates.
5. Update readme with Organization and files structure.
6. Create slides
7. Introduce the translator to the world.

## Organization
It has been a short, relatively simple and with little time project so I found more efficient to not to use too much time into organizing.
